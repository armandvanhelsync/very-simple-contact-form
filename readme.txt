= Credits =
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you! 
And a special thanks to the friendly users of 'PHP hulp' for helping me to create bugfree code.

I used these scripts for developing the Very Simple Contact Form:

Enjoy,

== Installation == 
After installation please add shortcode [contact] on your contactpage for displaying the form. 

In this case messages will be send to email from admin (Settings > General).

If you want to use another email, use shortcode [contact email_to="your-email-here"].

And if you want to use multiple email, use shortcode [contact email_to="first-email-here, second-email-here"].

Note: the sidebar widget uses email from admin (Settings > General).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I don't like the form layout, how can I change this? =
Form will use theme styling for input fields and submit button. 

Custom Style editor included: you can change the layout (CSS) of your form using the custom style page in WP dashboard. Max. 1000 characters allowed.

= Why am I not receiving messages? =
1) Look also in your junk/spam folder.

2) Check info about installation and check shortcode for mistakes.

3) Install another contactform plugin to determine if it's caused by Very Simple Contact Form or something else.

4) Messages are send using the wp-mail function, maybe your hostingprovider disabled the php mail function. Ask them to enable it. 

= Can I use multiple forms on the same website? =
Yes and no. Don't use multiple forms on the same website. This may cause a conflict. But you can use the shortcode on your contactpage and the widget on the same website.

= Is my language supported too? =
All UTF-8 characters are allowed, so many languages are supported. But the plugin itself is only translated in several languages. 

= Is this plugin protected against spammers, bots, etc? =
The default WordPress sanitization function is included.

For email field:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/sanitize_email

For other fields:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/sanitize_text_field

It also contains honeypot fields and a simple captcha sum.

= I notice there are 2 invisible fields (firstname and lastname), what's up with that? =
This is part of anti-spam: these are the 2 honeypot fields

= Other question or comment? =
Please open a topic in plugin forum or send me a message via my website.

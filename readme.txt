== Changelog == 
Version 1.0: first stable release


== DESCRIPTION ==
This is a very simple translation-ready contact form. It only contains Name, Email, Subject and Message. Use shortcode [contact] to display form on page. For more info please check readme file.


== INSTALATION == 
After installation please add shortcode [contact] on your contactpage for displaying the form. In this case messages will be send to email from admin.
If you want to use another email, use shortcode [contact email="your[at]email.address"].
And if you want to use multiple email, use shortcode [contact email="your[at]email.address, your[at]email.address"].


== OTHER NOTES ==
I only added minimum styling (css), so this form will use most of it from your own theme. 
Of course you can add your own styling in plugins stylesheet 'vscf_style'.

This plugin is translation-ready (Dutch translation included). 
You can translate this into your own language using for example plugin Codestyling Localization: http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/


== CREDITS ==
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop my theme, so: thank you!

Also I want to thank Abraham Nelson for his help with validation and sanitization.

I used this script for developing the Very Simple Contact Form:
